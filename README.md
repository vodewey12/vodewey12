#### About Myself
My name is Aaron Vo. I'm an experienced developer :keyboard:, who's a code-slinging movie buff :movie_camera:, video game  enthusiast :video_game:, and a former Star Wars fan (Yes, it's been a long, long journey to a far away galaxy with this one). The Force is still with me of course, but these days itâ€™s more of a tickle than a full-on [Vader force choke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p4T7_XI7WM). When I'm not busy scrummaging the mess that is my machine learning code, I like to take photos on my way-too-expensive camera and embark on many jet-setting adventures all over the world.

Here are the top 5 places I would love to visit in the future: 
1. Japan :jp:
2. Japan :mount_fuji:
3. Japan :japanese_castle:
4. South Korea :kr:
5. Japan :japan:
